# 🎧 Vibecast

**Vibecast** is 100% vibe-coded to download MP3 files from a given URL and play them back—because certain popular podcast apps are *less than FOSS*.

So here's this.

---

## ✅ What It Does (So Far)

- ✅ **Downloads MP3s from a URL** like it's 2004  
- ✅ **Plays them back** with adjustable speed  
- ✅ No tracking, no sign-in, no nonsense  

---

## 🚧 Coming Soon (When the vibe strikes)

- [ ] 🤖 AI-powered tagging + ad-skipping
- [ ] 🔁 Auto-downloads from sources you choose
- [ ] 🎨 A UI that doesn’t look like it was vibe coded in an evening

---

## 🧪 Why Does This Exist?

Because:
- You should own your media.
- The open web still rules.
- Some of us just want to `wget` a vibe and go.
